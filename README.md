CECS 274 - MODULE 2 PROJECT: ARRAY-BASED LISTS
Data Structure Implementations
Implement the ArrayStack, ArrayQueue and ArrayList data structures covered Module 2 (Array-
Based Lists). All the data structures should be fully functional and must follow the logic presented
in the lecture.

A Calculator System: A program that allows you to check whether a mathematical expres-
sion has balanced parentheses. Additional system functionalities will be implemented in future
projects.
A Bookstore System: A program that allows you to load a product database into a catalog. It
also allows you to search for items via catalog index or title infix. New items can be added to the
catalog, and existing items can be deleted. The program supports adding items to a shopping
cart and removing existing items in FIFO order.
